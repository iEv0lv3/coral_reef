# Coral Reef

**_Coral Reef_** is an opinionated syntax color theme for VS Code. I love the Ocean variant of the **_Material_** theme and it inspired me to design a custom syntax theme. I started with a color commonly found on [Coral Reefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef) that I wanted to include, the pink-ish string color in the theme, and utilized a color wheel to build around that color. The goal of the project is to create a highly readable syntax theme by approaching the process from a [Graphic Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design) perspective and implementing [Color Theory](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/).

If you need some help implementing Coral Reef the [VS Code documentation](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getstarted/settings/) for working with settings is excellent. I also included in this repo my `keybindings.json` file, and a copy of my `.zshrc` file as `zshrc.txt`.

You can find the **_Material_** theme for VS Code here:

After the Material theme is added to VS Code select the Ocean variant. To add the Coral Reef syntax theme copy the contents of `coral_reef.json` to your VS Code `settings.json` file. If you're interested in my entire VS Code customization copy the contents of `settings.json` to your VS Code `settings.json` file. Coral Reef will work with any theme, but my favorite is Material Ocean and that's the environment I designed it in. The Coral Reef theme is optimized for Ruby and Python, but it works well with a variety of languages. In order to exactly replicate the exmaples below a font that supports ligatures is required, such as [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode).

## Powerlevel9k Example

The `.zshrc` configuration I use is also included in this repo as `zshrc.txt`, and it contains my entire setup. Within that setup are my `Powerlevel9k` settings. For the Powerlevel9k settings to work as expected [Ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k), and [Nerd Fonts Complete](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) are required. My favorite font is [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode), the Retina version. If you're new to customizing the terminal check out this great article for some guidance: [How to Configure your macOs Terminal with Zsh like a Pro](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/).

### Project Status

This project is active and will recieve regular updates. I will continue to iterate on the Python and Ruby versions of Coral Reef, as well as adding optimization for addtional languages. If you'd like to submit an optimization for your favorite language PRs are welcome!

#### I hope you enjoy Coral Reef!
