**_Coral Reef_** is a syntax color theme for VS Code. I love the Ocean variant of the **_Material_** theme and I was inspired to make a custom syntax theme for it. Also included in this repo is my `keybindings.json` file, and a copy of my `.zshrc` file as `zshrc.txt`.

You can find the **_Material_** theme for VS Code here:

After the Material theme is added to VS Code select the Ocean variant. To add the Coral Reef syntax theme copy the contents of `coral_reef.json` to your VS Code `settings.json` file. If you are interested in my entire VS Code customization copy the contents of `settings.json` to your VS Code `settings.json` file. Coral Reef will work with any theme, but my favorite is Material Ocean and that's the environment I designed it in. The Coral Reef theme is optimized for Ruby and Python, but it works well with a variety of languages.
