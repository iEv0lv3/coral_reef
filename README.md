# Coral Reef

**_Coral Reef_** is a syntax color theme for VS Code. I love the Ocean variant of the **_Material_** theme and I was inspired to make a custom syntax theme for it. Also included in this repo is my `keybindings.json` file, and a copy of my `.zshrc` file as `zshrc.txt`. If you need some help implementing Coral Reef the [VS Code documentation](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getstarted/settings/) for working with settings is excellent.

You can find the **_Material_** theme for VS Code here:

After the Material theme is added to VS Code select the Ocean variant. To add the Coral Reef syntax theme copy the contents of `coral_reef.json` to your VS Code `settings.json` file. If you are interested in my entire VS Code customization copy the contents of `settings.json` to your VS Code `settings.json` file. Coral Reef will work with any theme, but my favorite is Material Ocean and that's the environment I designed it in. The Coral Reef theme is optimized for Ruby and Python, but it works well with a variety of languages. In order to exactly replicate the exmaples below a font that supports ligatures is required, such as my favorite [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode).

## Powerlevel9k Example

The `.zshrc` configuration I use is also included in this repo as `zshrc.txt`, and it contains my entire setup. Within that setup are my `Powerlevel9k` settings. For the Powerlevel9k settings to work as expected [Ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k), and [Nerd Fonts Complete](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) are required. My favorite font is [FiraCode](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode), the Reinta version.
